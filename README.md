<h1> How To Play </h1>

<h2> Initial Page </h2>
Click on the "Choose Matching Game Settings" link to review through the memory matching game. Click on the "Choose Question Settings" link to review through multiple choice questions. Click the "Show Art Images" button to see the full set of images that have been input into the site so far. (Note: this only shows the images, not the additional identifying information yet.) Click the "Show Art Images" button again to hide the images.

<h2> Choose Settings </h2>
Click on the unit that you want to review. You can only review one unit at a time, or all units at the same time. The first button clicked will be the unit registered by the site. If you want to choose a different unit, reload the site. Currently, only units from Global Prehistory to Indigenous Americas have information input in the site, so only those buttons will work properly. Once you have chosen a unit, select the type of identifier you want to review, then click "Continue". If you want to review the images themselves, select "forms".

<h2> Memory Matching Game </h2>
Click on a card to "flip" it, so it shows the information on it. Then click on another card to do the same. For two cards to match, one must state the name of the image and the type of identifier, and the other must state the identifier for that image, or show the image in the case of forms. For example, one card could state "Anthropomorphic Stele material" and the other card could state "sandstone" for the match to be correct. If a match is correct, the cards will turn white and the border will turn green, and they cannot be clicked again. If the match is incorrect, the cards will briefly turn red before hiding the information again. Once all matches have been correctly paired, a screen saying "You completed the game! Click return to play again." will appear. The return button will redirect you to the initial page.

<h2> Multiple Choice Review </h2>
The prompt will state the image being referred to and the type of identifier The answer chioces will state the identifier for that image, or show the image in the case of forms. To see the answer choices, click the "Show Answer Choices" button. To hide the answer choices, click the "Show Answer Choices" button again. If the answer choice you click is incorrect, it will turn and stay red. Try as many times as needed to get the right answer, since all incorrect answer choices will turn red. Once you have clicked the correct answer choice, it will turn green, then move to the next question. Questions are chosen randomly and do not end. To stop playing, click the "End Game" button, which will show a screen saying "You completed the game! Click return to play again." The return button will redirect you to the initial page.
